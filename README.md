#Critical Coding Rules:
1. Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
2. Variable names follow the same convention as function names.
3. Use one leading underscore only for non-public methods and instance variables.
4. Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words. Examples include MAX_OVERFLOW and TOTAL.
